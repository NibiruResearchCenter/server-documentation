## Step 1 - Bind Bilibili

We require you to have a Bilibili account to confirm your identity and information related to the Bilibili Live Guard (Supporter).

Please go to `#帐号绑定频道` and send the command `/account bind bili`, you will get a QR code, which will be valid for 2 minutes. Please use your Bilibili mobile client to scan the QR code to login. After this operation, the bot will use your login cookie to get your UID and will delete the cookie afterwards, so please don't worry about your account security. The bot is running on a Tencent Cloud Server in Shanghai, China. The bot program is open source and you can view the source code for this feature.

After successful login, you will be notified of the login operation on Bilibili by the official Bilibili account "哔哩哔哩智能姬". "设备/平台" is "未知设备"，"登录方式" is "扫码登录"，"参考登录地" is "中国上海". Click "查看详情" and you can get the IP of the "参考登录地点" which is "81.69.\*\*\*. \*\*\*" in Shanghai, China.

:::caution
The Kaiheila bot is not stable. When this operation is performed, it is possible that the QR code haven't returned for 30 seconds. If this happens, please wait 10 minutes (slow mode limit) and try again. If the second attempt still fails, please contact the administrator.
